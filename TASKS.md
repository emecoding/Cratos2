// 1: Resource manager update
    - Load all resources automatically from all the directories set.

//2: Automatic Renderer creation
    - No need for the user to create the renderer by hand.

3: Config file update
    - Application.set_config_file
    - For example: Application.create_config_window
    - Config file reader that can be used from anywhere the program.

4: Text Rendering

5: Sort all cameras
    - Come up with an algorithm that decides the most important camera, and makes the renderer use that.

//6: Change all the Application.application_systems to getters and setters.

//7: Change every function and variable from_this_style_of_names to ThisStyleOfNames
    - Also the package names LikeThis.


8: More debug messages and errors

9: Update documentation
    - Add supported file types to documentation (png, obj)
    - After task 7 update the function names
    - How to name shaders (folder has to contain the word 'shader' and .vs ans .fs endings for the files)

//10: Change material to resource

//11: BoxCollider.RenderDebugRect
    - Just a 3D model rendering on top of the object

//12: Load every resource from path
    - Not maybe loading from path, but resources can be loaded from anywhere now.

//13: Camera Yaw, Pitch, Raw
